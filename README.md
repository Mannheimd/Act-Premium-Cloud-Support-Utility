# Act! Premium Cloud Support Utility
This is a utility designed to enable frontline support to use existing Jenkins jobs without requiring a browser login.

The first iteration of this will enable support agents to run basic Jenkins jobs from the desktop client.

Once this is in place, I'll also work to add integration with Infor CRM so that accounts can be easily located using ticket numbers and/or account numbers.

Next, I'll work on having the utility feed information directly into the Infor ticket when a job is run. This may require a ticket number to be provided by the frontline agent for some jobs.
